# Life Cycle of a Beer.


## Possible Hypothesis: 

- There is an optimal lifecycle of a specialty brew based on the sales characteristics of past specialty brews
- There are indicators that show that some recipes are more optimal than others
- There is an optimal number of specialty brews to have at a given time based on sales
- There is an ideal mix of specialty brews in terms of variety
- Customers fit a profile based on tastes
- Customers of specific profile like a particular amount of variation

## Initial challenges
- obtaining data
- choosing what data to focus on
- Working with the brewery to get insight into what data would be most useful to them
- Sanitizing data such that personal data was not being compromised
- Addressing other privacy concerns around sensitive data being publicly available

## Motivation
- The part of data science that I am most passionate about is solving real world problems. I know that this brewery has been adversly affected by covid and it is a place that I personally care about. I wanted to help, and the thing that I can bring to the table there in particular that nobody else was equipped to do, is Data Science.
- Ultimately, the reason I chose to work on this is that the study of specialty brews was both interesting to me and it seemed like a great place to make an impact for this business.

## Data Collection

The data was collected directly from the brewery point of sale software.

All data was screened and scrubbed for personally identifiable information.
